## PROJECT II

## [Amazon Sales Dashboard](https://github.com/Anthonyomowumi/github.io/blob/main/Amazon%20Sales%20Dashboard.xlsx)

**Tools Used:**  
Pivot Table, Pivot Charts, Conditional Formatting, Formulas like SUM, COUNT and IF, Sorting and Filtering, Slicer and Timeline.

### Project Description:
This project involved creating an interactive Amazon sales dashboard using Pivot Tables in Excel to analyze data. The dashboard provided a detailed view of key metrics, 
such as Total Sales by Location, Total Sales by Product, Quantity Sold by Category, Order Status Distribution, Payment Methods, and Customer Insights. 
The dashboard allows stakeholders to monitor and assess sales performance across various regions and product categories, thereby improving customer targeting, 
optimizing payment methods, and enhancing overall sales tracking.The dashboard includes the following features:

**•	Total Sales by Customer’s Location:** Highlights the total sales generated in each customer region, helping to identify key markets and tailor targeted strategies for customer engagement and regional growth.

**•	Total Sales by Product:** Shows the overall sales performance for each product, enabling the identification of top-performing items and areas for potential inventory or marketing optimization.

**•	Quantity Sold by Category:** highlights the total quantity sold across different product categories, providing insights into customer preferences and helping to guide inventory and marketing decisions.

**•	Order Status Distribution:** Displays the distribution of orders based on their status (e.g., Pending, Completed, or Cancelled), offering insights into the order fulfillment process
and helping to identify areas for improvement in processing and customer satisfaction.

**•	Payment Methods:** Analyzes the distribution of orders by payment method, including Amazon Pay, Gift Card, Credit Card, Debit Card, and PayPal. This provides insights into 
customer payment preferences and can provide strategies for optimizing payment options and improving the checkout experience.

The dashboard includes interactive slicers and a timeline:

**•	Month:** Filter data by month or date range for detailed sales trend analysis.

**•	Category:** Assess performance across product categories like Books, Electronics, Clothing, Footwear, and Home Appliances.

**•	Product:** Analyze the performance of individual products within each category for granular insights.

### Some Key Findings:

**•	Electronics Lead in Sales Volume:** Analysis of Quantity Sold by Category showed that Electronics consistently had the highest sales volume, making it the top-performing category during the period.

**•	Top Payment Methods Identified:** Between February and April, PayPal and Credit Card were the most frequently used payment methods, while Gift Card and Amazon Pay were the least 
used—highlighting customer preferences that can inform payment strategy.


**•	Regional Sales Insight – Miami:** Miami recorded the highest total sales, particularly within the Electronics category, indicating strong regional demand for tech products.

**•	Order Status Monitoring Needed:** Although completed orders (88) were the highest, the number of Pending (85) and cancelled (77) orders was also significant. This suggests 
a need for closer monitoring of the fulfillment process. The high cancellation rate may point to potential issues with payment methods or order processing delays that warrant further investigation.

**The dashboard facilitates strategic decision-making in areas including inventory planning, regional marketing, customer engagement, payment optimization, and fulfillment process improvement by providing data-driven insights.**
